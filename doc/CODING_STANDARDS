Syntax and indentation
----------------------

For .ii-files:

* Use a tab for indenting (you can resize the width of tabs in your editor).  Spaces are dirty, using tabs here allows consistency.
* Curly braces stand behind the function. (POSIX).
* Comments should take the form "# comment" not just "#comment", as "#if" is an ifile processor statement.
* #ifd, #elsed and other ifile processor tags should not be indented.
* Scripts should be indented. (usually with 2 tabs.)
* Variables should be in braces: ${var}.  This is both for clarity, and to prevent problems parsing the script.
* Every executable must be prefixed and suffixed with '@', as @/usr/bin/foo@.  Note the 'echo' statement does not.
	Note the @ symbols surround the binary, not command line arguments, "@/usr/bin/foo@ -f" not "@/usr/bin/foo -f@"
* Scripts must be POSIX-compliant for portability.  Can be tested with bash or other POSIX-compliant shells.
* No service or daemon should depend on system/initial.  Use "need = system/bootmisc;"
